        Jonathan is out on dinner with friends where they all just decided to go on a trip together to South East Asia. They only made the decision now and would like to go in December for 2 weeks. Jonathan would like to look at possibilities for accommodation and sightseeing to get an idea of what the trip would cost all of them. He inputs the date and countries they would like to visit to get a estimation of what the trip would cost for all of them and what sightseeing activities they would be able to enjoy.
